Over 20 fundamental changes include broader and more flexible execution resources, significantly higher load/store bandwidth to enable execution, and an optimized user interface to incorporate more threads into the process faster.\r\nIncreased Instructions per Clock (IPC): The \"Zen 3\" architecture can extract an average of 19% more performance from each MHz of frequency compared to the previous generation. This is a historic IPC improvement for this generation, and a key player in the architecture\'s ability to deliver unprecedented single-core performance.\r\nReduced Latency: The \"Zen 3\" architecture transitions to a new \"unified complex\" design that incorporates 8 cores and 32 MB of L3 cache in a single resource group. This significantly reduces core-to-core and core-to-cache latencies by turning each element of the array into a next-door neighbor with minimal communication time. Latency-sensitive tasks, such as PC gaming, particularly benefit from this change as tasks now have direct access to twice the L3 cache compared to the \"Zen 2\" architecture.\r\nKing of the Hill: The combination of higher IPC and the unified 8-core complex is a potent combination for gaming. Customers transitioning from AMD Ryzen™ 3000 series to the 5000 series can expect a 26% better gaming performance at 1080p. But that’s not all: processors featuring the \"Zen 3\" architecture, such as the AMD Ryzen™ 9 5900X, are the best in the world for PC gaming.\r\nIncredible Efficiency: The performance improvements of the \"Zen 3\" architecture are offered without an increase in power consumption or TDP. The combination of cutting-edge architecture and industry-leading 7nm technology gives the AMD Ryzen™ 5000 series processor a generational improvement of over 24% in energy efficiency, making it 2.8 times better than competing architectures.\r\nSpecifications\r\nProcessor:\r\n\r\nManufacturer: AMD\r\nModel: 5965WX\r\nBase Frequency: 3.8 GHz\r\nFamily: AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO\r\nNumber of
