2	AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5965WX 3.8GHz/4.5GHz	10000000	Amd	The Ryzen Threadripper PRO 5000 WX-Series processors combine the incredible performance of the "Zen 3" architecture with enterprise-grade security features, ease of management, and scalability of AMD PRO technologies.\r\n\r\nWith higher frequencies and an enhanced L3 cache architecture, the new Ryzen Threadripper PRO processors enable users to tackle the most demanding workloads.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nTotal Redesign: The "Zen 3" architecture represents the most comprehensive design overhaul of the "Zen" era. With over 20 fundamental changes, including wider and more flexible execution resources, significantly increased load/store bandwidth for execution, and an optimized user interface to incorporate more threads into the process and do it faster.\r\n\r\nMore Instructions Per Clock (IPC): The "Zen 3" architecture can extract an average of 19% additional performance from each MHz of frequency compared to the previous generation. This is a historic IPC improvement for this generation and a key player in the architecture's ability to deliver unprecedented single-core performance.\r\n\r\nLower Latency: The "Zen 3" architecture transitions to a new "unified complex" design incorporating 8 cores and 32 MB of L3 cache in a single resource group. This significantly reduces core-to-core and core-to-cache latencies by making each element of the array a next-door neighbor with minimal communication time. Latency-sensitive tasks, such as PC gaming, especially benefit from this change, as tasks now have direct access to double the L3 cache compared to the "Zen 2" architecture.\r\n\r\nKing of the Hill: The combination of higher IPC and the unified 8-core complex is a potent mix for gaming. Customers upgrading from AMD Ryzen™ 3000 series to the 5000 series can expect up to a 26% better gaming performance at 1080p. But that's not all: processors featuring the "Zen 3" architecture, like the AMD Ryzen™ 9 5900X, are the best in the world for PC gaming.\r\n\r\nIncredible Efficiency: The performance improvements of the "Zen 3" architecture can be delivered without an increase in power consumption or TDP. The combination of cutting-edge architecture and its industry-leading 7nm technology gives the AMD Ryzen™ 5000 series processors a generational energy efficiency improvement of over 24% and a 2.8x lead over competing architectures.	store/static/media/products/P2.png	store/static/media/products/P2-2.png	100	1

5	Intel Core i9-10980XE 3 GHz Extreme Edition	5300000	Intel	Compatible with Intel® Optane™ Memory. Intel® Optane™ memory is a new and revolutionary type of non-volatile memory that sits between system memory and storage to accelerate system performance and responsiveness. Combined with the Intel® Rapid Storage Technology controller, it seamlessly manages multiple levels of storage while presenting a single virtual drive to the operating system, allowing frequently used data to reside on the fastest storage tier. Intel® Optane™ memory requires specific hardware and software configuration.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\nIntel® Turbo Boost Technology Version: Intel® Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom to give you a burst of speed when you need it and increased energy efficiency when you don’t.\r\n\r\nIntel® Hyper-Threading Technology: Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology delivers two processing threads per physical core. Highly threaded applications can get more work done in parallel, completing tasks sooner.\r\n\r\nIntel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x): Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) allows one hardware platform to function as multiple "virtual" platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.\r\n\r\nIntel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d): Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) continues from the existing support for IA-32 (VT-x) and Itanium® processor (VT-i) virtualization, adding new support for I/O device virtualization. Intel VT-d can help end users improve the security and reliability of the systems and also improve I/O device performance in a virtualized environment.\r\n\r\nIntel® 64: The Intel® 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, PC, and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software.¹ The Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both physical and virtual memory.\r\n\r\nInstruction Set: An instruction set refers to the basic set of commands and instructions that a microprocessor understands and can execute. The value shown represents which Intel instruction set this processor is compatible with.\r\n\r\nInstruction Set Extensions: Instruction set extensions are additional instructions that can increase performance when the same operations are performed on multiple data objects. These may include SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions).\r\n\r\nNumber of AVX-512 FMA Units: Intel® Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (AVX-512) are the new instruction set extensions that provide extremely wide (512-bit) vector operations capabilities with up to 2 FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) units to accelerate performance for the most demanding computational tasks.\r\n\r\nEnhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology: Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology is an advanced means of enabling very high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Traditional Intel SpeedStep® Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as separation between voltage and frequency changes and clock partitioning and recovery.\r\n\r\nIntel® Deep Learning Boost (Intel® DL Boost): A new set of processor technologies designed to accelerate AI deep learning use cases. It extends Intel AVX-512 with a new Vector Neural Network Instruction (VNNI), which significantly increases deep learning inference performance over previous generations.	store/static/media/products/P5.png	store/static/media/products/P5-5.png	100	1

The 1080p FaceTime HD camera shows your best side, whether in family gatherings or video calls with clients across the globe.\r\n\r\nSurround sound system. The MacBook Air's speakers create a three-dimensional experience when playing videos and music with Dolby Atmos and spatial audio.\r\n\r\nWords that make an impression. In addition to being comfortable and quiet, the backlit Magic Keyboard comes with full-size function keys and Touch ID for easy, fast, and secure Mac unlock and app login with just a touch.\r\n\r\nFeel the connection. The MagSafe port has magnets that snap on the charging cable with just a touch and release instantly if someone trips over it. The two Thunderbolt ports let you connect and charge high-speed accessories or even a 6K monitor. And the 3.5mm headphone jack supports high-impedance headphones.	store/static/media/products/L5.png	store/static/media/products/m3_e0YtK4v.png	100	3
